### Who?
This site is made by me, [onlyteo](https://onlyteo.com). Welcome!

I'm a developer and technical architect with more than {{% years-since 2011 %}} years of experience developing enterprise software in both private and public sector.


### What?
This is a techie site at heart. So it will mostly contain articles and tutorials about all different kinds of technology topics. Subjects such as computers, telecommunication, software development, technical architecture, development methodologies, infrastructure and other topics that tech nerds enjoy.

### How?
The site is created using the lightweight [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator. It is styled and structured using the [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) theme. The whole site is versioned in a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository. Upon committing changes to the site is build using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). No database or other runtime components needed!
